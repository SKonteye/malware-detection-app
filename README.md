# Malware Detector

**Project Description:**
The Malware Detector project involves training a machine learning model using a provided dataset in CSV format. The model is trained by comparing four different algorithms, each simulated to find optimal hyperparameters using grid search. After comparing the performance of these algorithms, the Bagging Classifier emerged with the best results in the classification report. Consequently, the model was trained using the Bagging Classifier, and Pickle was used for persisting the trained model. All details regarding the project, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, are documented in the project notebook.

**Installation:**
No installation is required for this project. The main Python file has been used with Streamlit to deploy the application, which includes a minimal design to accept executable files (.exe) as input and display the classification result (malware or benign).

**Usage:**
To use the Malware Detector:
1. Upload an executable file (not greater than 200MB) to the platform.
2. Wait for the platform to process the file and perform its analysis.
3. View the classification result displayed as text, indicating whether the file is classified as malware or benign.
